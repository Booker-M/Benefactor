# Senior Capstone Project: _Fractured Star_

By: Booker Martin, Caitlin Colina, Megan Reyes, Michael Elias

Fractured Star is tactical role-playing game with a story that hinges on the balance between making moral decisions and pursuing power. This project will feature fully interactive, partially procedurally-generated levels.

## Main Storyline

Shooting stars are falling from the sky from a shattered meteor fragment, and people are fighting over these shards. Some people are granted powers, others are collecting them, and some want to abuse their potential for science.

Two brothers go on an adventure when the younger brother awakens a mysterious power and wants to save those granted similar powers from the corrupted scientists and police force by tracking them down first.

## Justification

One problem tactical RPGs commonly face is limited level variety / repetitive level design with limited interactivity by the player.

Most games have levels that are set in stone — the same upon every playthrough of the game — and also lack the ability to react to gameplay / combat. Our game will be one of the first of its kind to feature partially procedurally-generated levels in which every component of the level can be interacted with by the player.

The game will be split between monumental “story” levels home to important landmarks in the game story and “traversal” levels that are entirely procedural. Every level changes as the player progresses through the level — explosions will damage and destroy the surrounding environments, characters can break down walls, and all containers can be searched and looted.

This creates a more interactive experience compared to typical games of the tactical RPG genre.
