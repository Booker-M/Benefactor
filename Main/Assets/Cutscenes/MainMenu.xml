		Notes to be wary of:
		 -Currently, page elements must contain all 6 properties. This would ideally not be the case 
		 -Page numbers are numbered strangely to make changing them possible without having to change every other page
			number. The code currently iterates through each page number to access this data, so it does need to be sequential
		 -Other values I want to add would be <fadeOutTime>, <fadeInTime>, a delay type, and a SFX type
		 -Need to implement SFX System
